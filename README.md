# Analyzing-eCommerce-Business-Performance-with-SQL
I utilized SQL to process data at an ecommerce company and created business performance reports on three aspects, including customer growth, product quality, and payment types. In addition, data analysis techniques were implemented to identify patterns and trends in customer behavior, product performance, and payment methods. Ultimately, I provided insights and recommendations to the company to improve their customer acquisition, product development, and payment processing strategies.
